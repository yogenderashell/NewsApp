If, for any reason, you encounter issues running the app, follow the steps below:

1. Open your terminal in the same folder where MyApp is located.

2. Type the following command and press Enter:
`$env:NODE_OPTIONS = "--openssl-legacy-provider"`.
3. Try running the app again:
`npm start`.
This should resolve most common installation problems related to Node Sass or other libraries.

This command sets the NODE_OPTIONS environment variable to use the --openssl-legacy-provider. It can help resolve compatibility issues related to OpenSSL.
